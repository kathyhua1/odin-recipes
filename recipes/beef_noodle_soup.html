    <p> This is a recipe for a warm day. And a few more things we want to talk about.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Broth</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1.5 lbs (700g) beef shank or beef chuck (cut into large chunks)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic (crushed)</li>
    <li>1 large onion (sliced)</li>
    <li>3 green onions (cut into 2-inch pieces)</li>
    <li>1-inch piece ginger (sliced)</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes (quartered)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup light soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp doubanjiang (fermented chili bean paste)</li>
    <li>2 star anise</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>3-4 dried red chilies (optional, for extra spice)</li>
    <li>6 cups beef broth (or water)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>2 tbsp rock sugar (or brown sugar)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For Serving</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Fresh wheat noodles (or dried noodles, cooked according to package instructions)</li>
    <li>Baby bok choy or spinach (blanched)</li>
    <li>Fresh cilantro (chopped)</li>
    <li>Pickled mustard greens (optional)</li>
    <li>Green onions (thinly sliced, for garnish)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Prepare the beef. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the beef chunks for 3-4 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse the beef under cold water. Set aside.</li>
    <li> Make the Broth. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the blanched beef chunks and sear until browned on all sides. Remove and set aside. </li>
    <li> In the same pot, add garlic, onion, green onions, and ginger. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until fragrant.</li>
    <li> Stir in the quartered tomatoes and cook for an additional 3 minutes until they start to soften.</li>
    <li> Add the doubanjiang (fermented chili bean paste) and cook for another 1-2 minutes to release its flavors.</li>
    <li> Return the seared beef to the pot. Add light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, rock sugar, star anise, cinnamon stick, and dried red chilies (if using).</li>
    <li> Pour in the beef broth (or water) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2 - 2.5 hours, or until the beef is tender.</li>
    <li> Prepare Noodles & Vegetables. While the broth is simmering, cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside. 
        Blanch the bok choy or spinach in boiling water for 1-2 minutes until just tender. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li> Assemble the Soup. Once the beef is tender, taste the broth and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
        Remove the star anise, cinnamon stick, and any large pieces of ginger.</li>
    <li> In serving bowls, add the cooked noodles, then ladle the hot beef broth and chunks of beef over the noodles.
        Top with blanched bok choy, chopped cilantro, pickled mustard greens (if using), and sliced green onions.</li>
  </ol>
