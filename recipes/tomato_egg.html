    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 scallion, whites and greens separated</li>
    <li>2 small to medium tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
    <li>salt and white pepper for taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Prepare the eggs. In a bowl, beat the eggs with the sesame oil, a pinch of salt and white pepper (if using).
        Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil.
        Pour in the beaten eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are just set but still soft and slightly runny. Transfer the eggs to a plate and set aside.</li>
    <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Add the whites of the scallion and sauté for about 20-30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the tomato and cook for about 2 minutes until they start to soften.</li>
    <li>Add the ketchup, stirring well to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add a tablespoon of water to adjust the consistency.</li>
    <li>Simmer for another 1-2 minutes until the tomatoes release their juices and the sauce becomes rich and flavorful.</li> 
    <li>Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet with the tomato mixture.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and garnish with chopped green onions.</li>
  </ol>
